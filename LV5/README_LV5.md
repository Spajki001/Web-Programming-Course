# **LV5 important notes**

## Before start

- You have to make a symbolic link to `htdocs` folder for easier accessibility while coding.
- You can create the link by running<br>
`ln -s /opt/lampp/htdocs /home/spajki/Web-Programming-Course/LV6/htdocs`<br>
command in Linux terminal after moving to `LV6` directory.

## Zad2

- It is required to install xampp. You have to move `DataZad2.json` file to XAMPP `htdocs` directory and add the `<script>` code from `Zad2.html` file to the `applications.html` file in `htdocs` directory.
- After doing everything, you have to start the Apache web server in XAMPP and access it through the browser.

## Zad3

- This task needed me to make a simple web page with the title, paragraph and an image (which I made in `Zad3.html` file).
- After I did that, I had to do the changes from task 3 using the jQuery console commands (which I wrote in `Zad3Commands.md` file).
