# **Web-Programming-Course**

## Author: Mateo SpajiÄ‡

- All examples from my web programming course in "Basics" folder just for future reference.
- Every LV has it's own pdf file that has all the tasks I had to do for that LV.
- LV tasks are made by me on laboratory exercises.
- Some LV directories have it's own `README_LV#.md` when there are important notes for that directory.
- All commands in `README_LV#.md` are written for Linux terminal.
